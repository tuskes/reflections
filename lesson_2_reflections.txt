What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates a git repository with a .git file. use comands git init to initialize the new or existing directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working directory - files in the directory (not committed)
staging area - files (changes) to be committed
git repository - files in the directory (committed)

the staging area allows you to have more control over which files should be committed.
